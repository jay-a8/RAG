The Nearly Autonomous Management and Control (NAMAC) system supports the advanced reactor operation by
recommending control actions to operators based on real-time measurements and digital twins (DTs) learning
from the knowledge base. To enable the safe and reliable use of autonomous technologies, NAMAC and
its recommendations should be trustworthy to operators and regulators at both the design and operation
stages. This study proposes a NAMAC trustworthiness modeling and evaluation framework supported by
trustworthiness ontologies and evidence-based approaches. The development-time and run-time ontologies
are separately constructed and then converted to Bayesian networks to quantitatively evaluate the NAMAC
trustworthiness. This evaluation is demonstrated by collecting and characterizing evidence from NAMAC
practices, such as the development and assessment of the NAMAC system, data coverage assessment, and
the training and optimizations of neural-network-based DTs. Our proposed approach can aggregate various
trustworthiness attributes of complex artificial-intelligence-supported systems for safety-critical applications.
It also considers the interaction between different DTs and extends beyond the trustworthiness evaluation
of a single DT. The evidence-based method enhances the transparency of the trustworthiness modeling and
evaluation processes and helps identify uncertainties and subjectivity involved in the processes.The Nearly Autonomous Management and Control (NAMAC) system supports the advanced reactor operation by

trustworthiness. This evaluation is demonstrated by collecting and characterizing evidence from NAMAC
practices, such as the development and assessment of the NAMAC system, data coverage assessment, and
the training and optimizations of neural-network-based DTs. Our proposed approach can aggregate various
trustworthiness attributes of complex artificial-intelligence-supported systems for safety-critical applications.
It also considers the interaction between different DTs and extends beyond the trustworthiness evaluation
of a single DT. The evidence-based method enhances the transparency of the trustworthiness modeling and
evaluation processes and helps identify uncertainties and subjectivity involved in the processes.The Nearly Autonomous Management and Control (NAMAC) system supports the advanced reactor operation by
recommending control actions to operators based on real-time measurements and digital twins (DTs) learning
from the knowledge base. To enable the safe and reliable use of autonomous technologies, NAMAC and
its recommendations should be trustworthy to operators and regulators at both the design and operation
stages. This study proposes a NAMAC trustworthiness modeling and evaluation framework supported by
trustworthiness ontologies and evidence-based approaches. The development-time and run-time ontologies
are separately constructed and then converted to Bayesian networks to quantitatively evaluate the NAMAC
trustworthiness. This evaluation is demonstrated by collecting and characterizing evidence from NAMAC
